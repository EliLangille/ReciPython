# ReciPython
A capstone project for NSCC to build a recipe search engine with an interactive GUI.

## Setup
To run this project, you will need to set up a virtual environment with:
- Python 3.9+
- pip
- PySide6
- dotenv

Alternatively, you can run your OS's setup_and_run script (.bat for Windows, .sh for macOS/Linux) to take care of this and start running the app.
